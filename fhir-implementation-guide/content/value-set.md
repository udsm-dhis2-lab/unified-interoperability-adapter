# Value Set: Observation Categories

## Overview

The `Observation Categories` value set is used to categorize different types of **Observation** resources in the FHIR standard. Observations are used to represent measurements, assessments, and findings in healthcare, and categorizing these observations is critical for organizing and interpreting healthcare data.

## Purpose

This value set provides a set of predefined categories to help organize **Observation** resources. Categories are essential in various use cases, including:

- Organizing clinical data for analysis.
- Associating observations with specific domains, like laboratory or imaging.
- Simplifying query and retrieval of observations based on category.

## Categories Defined in this Value Set

The `ObservationCategories` value set includes the following categories:

- **vital-signs**: Observations related to laboratory tests, such as blood work, microbiology cultures, etc.
- **visit-notes**: Observations related to imaging studies, such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, etc.

## Usage

This value set is used to categorize **Observation** resources. For example, an `Observation` resource might include a category such as `vital-signs` if the observation relates to a clinical vital sign.
